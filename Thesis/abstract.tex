\prefacesection{Abstract}

This thesis develops a modular framework for developing 
property based tests of Haskell modules
using sampling strategies to automatically generate test cases.
A formal argument for program correctness is defined
to provide the basis for selecting test cases and interpreting successful tests as evidence.
Combinatorial enumerations of Haskell data types
are presented as a technique for supporting 
type independent strategies for sampling and generating test cases,
along with a comparison of other techniques already in use.
The \GC framework provides a modular architecture and Haskell library for 
integrating different sampling methods, evaluation strategies and reporting techniques to support
both research into property based testing and practical use by Haskell developers.
