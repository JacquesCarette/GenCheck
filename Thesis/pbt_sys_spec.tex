The specification consists of interfaces isolating each of these stages
and a suggested library of components that should be provided as a base implementation.
In Haskell interfaces can be implemented as typeclasses,
with each new variant an instance.
These interfaces and their use in the testing process are described in
this chapter.

\subsection{Generators}
Test generators exhibit a lot of the structure of the data they generate,
and thus their implementation is well-suited to
generic programming techniques.
The generator combinators provided by \QC, \SC, etc.
are good example of this.
