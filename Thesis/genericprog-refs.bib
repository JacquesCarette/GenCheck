Parametric polymorphism has been one of the most successful approaches to date but, as of yet, has not been applicable to programming with quotient datatypes such as unordered pairs, cyclic lists, bags etc. This paper provides the basis for writing polymorphic programs over quotient datatypes by extending our recently developed theory of containers.},

  abstract = {Datatype-generic programs are programs that are parametrized by a \emph{datatype} or \emph{type functor}. There are two main styles of datatype-generic programming: the \emph{Algebra of Programming} approach, characterized by structured recursion operators parametrized by a shape functor, and the \emph{Generic Haskell} approach, characterized by case analysis over the structure of a datatype. We show that the former enjoys a kind of parametricity, relating the behaviours of generic functions at different types; in contrast, the latter is more ad~hoc, with no coherence required or provided between the various clauses of a definition.}

@inbook{ComparingGP,
    abstract = {The last decade has seen a number of approaches to datatype-generic programming: PolyP, Functorial ML, Scrap Your Boilerplate, Generic Haskell, Generics for the Masses, and so on. The approaches vary in sophistication and target audience: some propose full-blown programming languages, some suggest libraries, some can be seen as categorical programming methods. In these lecture notes we compare the various approaches to datatype-generic programming in Haskell. We introduce each approach by means of example, and we evaluate it along different dimensions (expressivity, ease of use, and so on).},
