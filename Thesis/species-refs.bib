title = {Species: making analytic functors practical for functional programming},
note = {submitted for publication MSFP2008},

abstract = {
Inspired by Joyalís theory of species, we show how to add new type constructors
and constructor combinators to the tool set of functional languages.  We show
that all the important properties of inductive types lift to this new setting.
Species are analytic functors, representing a broader range of structures
than regular functors.  This includes structures such as bags, cycles
and graphs.  The theory is greatly inspired by combinatorics rather than type
theory:  this adds interesting new tools to bear, but also requires more work
on our part to show that species form a good foundations for a theory of type
constructors.  The combinatorial tools provide a calculus for these structures
which has strong links with classical analysis, via a functorial interpretation
of generating series.  Furthermore, we show how generic programming idioms also
generalise to this richer setting.  Once the theory is understood, various
methods of implementation are relatively straightforward.}

abstract = {The concept of generalised species of structures between small categories and, correspondingly, that of generalised analytic functor between presheaf categories are introduced. An operation of substitution for generalised species, which is the counterpart to the composition of generalised analytic functors, is also put forward. These definitions encompass most notions of combinatorial species considered in the literature  including of course Joyal's original notion  together with their associated substitution operation. Our first main result exhibits the substitution calculus of generalised species as arising from a Kleisli bicategory for a pseudo-comonad on profunctors. Our second main result establishes that the bicategory of generalised species of structures is cartesian closed.

	    combinatorial structures and their traversal algorithms. A
	    combinatorial type is decomposable if it admits a
	    specification in terms of unions, products, sequences,
	    sets, and cycles, either in the labelled or in the unlabelled
	    context. Many properties of decomposable structures are
	    decidable. Generating function equations, counting
	    sequences, and random generation algorithms can be compiled
	    from specifications. Asymptotic properties can be
	    determined automatically for a reasonably large subclass.
	    Maple libraries that implement such decision procedures are
	    briefly surveyed (LUO, combstruct, equivalent). In
	    addition, libraries for manipulating holonomic sequences
	    and functions are presented (gfun, Mgfun).},
